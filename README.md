## About
Analyze the district-wide test results based on every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Then aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Summary
After merging the student and school data together, we were able to determine trends in each student's math and reading scores. The analysis started at a very high level by reviewing the entire district's data and determining what the passing rate for each school was for reading and math. From there, we were able to get more granular with our data analysis as we wanted to uncover the trends that caused either a higher passing or failing rate within each school such as grade, school spending, size, and type. 

## Conclusions
- As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).
- As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).
- As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
- Students who attend charter schools outperformed the overall district passing percentage (65%) by 39%, while district school students performed -18% worse. A further analysis is required to determine if this is due to the many outstanding variables such as teacher qualifications and geo location of the schools. 
- Schools that spend the least amount per student outperformed the schools that spend the most on their students in overall passing percentage by 69%. Based on our analysis, as the schools spend more money per student the overall passing percentage decreases with each range. The range with the most amount of money spent ($645 - $680), underperforms compared to the overall passing percentage by -18%.
